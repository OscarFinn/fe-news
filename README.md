# THE NEWS FRONTIER - A NEWS FRONTEND PROJECT

The site is hosted here:

    https://thenewsfrontier.netlify.app

This is a frontend-end React application that interfaces with my custom-built backend API (https://github.com/OscarFinn/be-news) to display articles and comments, allow the user to sort articles and filter by topic with a user friendly UX design.

## INITIAL SETUP

The project was built using the following:

    node: 23.2.0

Clone the repository to a directory of your choice using git clone.

Run the following in the terminal from the project directory after cloning:

    npm install

To start the locally run page enter:

    npm run dev

Copy to the localhost link into your browser of choice to view the project.
